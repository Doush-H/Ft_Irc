# Ft_Irc
Simple Irc server (in progress)


## To-do:
- ### Kevin:

- ### Doush:
  - QUIT
  - USERS
     
- ### On hold:
  - LIST
  - MODE
  - Remove users from channel map efter disconnecting

- ### Done:
  - PRIVMSG
  - WHO (new)
  - PART
  - JOIN
  - TOPIC
  - Sending the channel users and the channel topic when someone joins the channel

## Notes:
- Maybe we should consider putting some of the bigger commands in seperate files because they are getting long
- Sorry if I broke something, did't have time to thoroughly test stuff
